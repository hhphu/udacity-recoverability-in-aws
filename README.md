# Udacity Project- Recoverability in AWS
This is one of the project in Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Nanodegree. Resources & instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/nd063-c2-design-for-availability-resilience-reliability-replacement-project-starter-template).

## Project Overview

In this project I have created highly available solutions to common use cases. I have:

- Built a Multi-AvailabilityZone, Multi-Region database and showed how to use it in multiple geographically separate AWS regions.  
- Built a website hosting solution that is versioned so that any data destruction and accidents can be quickly and easily undone.
